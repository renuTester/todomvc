UI Automation of ToDo MVC App



Cypress Automation Framework
Overview
This project is a Cypress-based test automation framework designed to provide an efficient and reliable solution for end-to-end testing of web applications. It includes automated tests that are easy to maintain, extend, and execute.

Installation
Follow these steps to install the framework and get started with Cypress.

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repo-url.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Node.js Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. For the required versions, see Environment Setup.

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file, including Cypress and other libraries required for running the tests.

Pre-requisites
Before you can run the tests, you need to have the following software installed:

Node.js (Version: v16.x or later)
npm (Version: 8.x or later)
Cypress (This will be installed automatically with the project dependencies)
You can verify the installed versions with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
If Node.js or npm are not installed, you can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Additional Tools
Visual Studio Code or any other IDE that supports JavaScript/TypeScript.
Git for version control (if not already installed).
Usage
Running the Cypress Tests
Once you’ve set up your environment, you can run the tests in headless or interactive mode:

Headless Mode (for CI/CD pipelines):
bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
This will run all tests in headless mode (no UI) and output the results in the console.

Interactive Mode:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, where you can view the tests and their results in a user-friendly interface.

Running Specific Tests
You can run specific tests using the --spec flag:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/example_spec.js"
This will only run the example_spec.js test file.

Running Tests in Different Browsers
You can also specify the browser to run your tests with:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --browser chrome
npx cypress run --browser firefox
Implemented Features
End-to-End Testing: Automated test cases that validate the overall user experience and behavior of the application.
Cross-Browser Testing: Support for multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Electron.
Cypress Dashboard Integration: Integration with the Cypress Dashboard for test reporting and parallelization (optional).
Screenshots and Video Recording: Captures screenshots on failure and records videos of the entire test suite for debugging purposes.
Custom Commands: Reusable Cypress custom commands for complex actions, making the tests more maintainable.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports running tests with different sets of data to verify multiple scenarios.
Environment-Specific Configurations: Cypress environment variables and custom configurations for different environments (e.g., staging, production).
Good Practices Followed
Modular Test Structure: Tests are organized into logical folders and files for easy navigation.
Reusable Test Functions: Common test steps are abstracted into reusable commands to avoid duplication.
Page Object Model: Implemented the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve maintainability.
CI/CD Integration: Cypress is configured to work seamlessly with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports running tests with various data sets to ensure robustness.
Error Handling: Tests include proper error handling and retry mechanisms for flaky elements.
Test Reporting: Integrated with test reporters (e.g., Mochawesome) for detailed and user-friendly test reports.
Environment Setup
Node.js and npm Versions
The framework is designed to work with the following versions of Node.js and npm:

Node.js: v16.x or later
npm: 8.x or later
Installing Dependencies
Once Node.js and npm are installed, run the following command in the project directory to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will automatically install Cypress and other dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Additional Information
Test Reports: Test reports can be found in the cypress/results folder if you’re using a test reporter like Mochawesome.
Cypress Documentation: For more detailed information on Cypress commands and configurations, refer to the official Cypress documentation: https://docs.cypress.io.
Custom Configurations: You can customize the cypress.json and tsconfig.json files for specific needs (e.g., base URL, test retries, etc.).
Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Ensure that all tests are passing and follow the coding standards used in the project.

THere can be lot of untested use cases. - example mouse hover an element and click the delete button
soft and hard assert
why we use object.freeze
only and skip >> multiple it with only and multiple it with skip
beforeEach at describe level and context level, which will execute
eachmethod
why we use . to get() commands
why we use css selector like element.class instead of .class
TAB plugin
I took the help from online
Add the comments
Any bug, it might be a bug that duplicate to-do items can be added, app loading gain delete the items
adding a high number of to-do items
When I go back it should not delete the to do items
Add tags
Add extensions
npm install should call pre-build and install extensions
type(`${}{enter}`,{delay:400})
I usually design the Page object model, but since this app doesn't have any pages so going with stand-alone test script
hard coded stings can be deleted
cy.get().contains() vs cy.get().should('have.text', '') //it match the full sting not a substring
Meaning and use of each file
Basic of Accessibility - a11y - https://www.browserstack.com/accessibility-testing/what-is-accessibility-testing
check / uncheck all matching 
      cy.get('ul.todo-list li input').check()

      patten to match in should have.text in todo spec file
Tags tries
