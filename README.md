Installation
Follow these steps to install the framework and get started with Cypress.

1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   Copy code
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Install Node.js Dependencies
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. For the required versions, see Environment Setup.

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file, including Cypress and other libraries required for running the tests.

Pre-requisites
Before you can run the tests, you need to have the following software installed:

Node.js (Version: v16.x or later)
npm (Version: 8.x or later)
Cypress (This will be installed automatically with the project dependencies)
You can verify the installed versions with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
If Node.js or npm are not installed, you can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Additional Tools
Visual Studio Code or any other IDE that supports JavaScript/TypeScript.
Git for version control (if not already installed).
Usage
Running the Cypress Tests
Once you’ve set up your environment, you can run the tests in headless or interactive mode:

Headless Mode (for CI/CD pipelines):
bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
This will run all tests in headless mode (no UI) and output the results in the console.

Interactive Mode:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, where you can view the tests and their results in a user-friendly interface.

Running Specific Tests
You can run specific tests using the --spec flag:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/example_spec.js"
This will only run the example_spec.js test file.

Running Tests in Different Browsers
You can also specify the browser to run your tests with:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --browser chrome
npx cypress run --browser firefox
Implemented Features
End-to-End Testing: Automated test cases that validate the overall user experience and behavior of the application.
Cross-Browser Testing: Support for multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Electron.
Cypress Dashboard Integration: Integration with the Cypress Dashboard for test reporting and parallelization (optional).
Screenshots and Video Recording: Captures screenshots on failure and records videos of the entire test suite for debugging purposes.
Custom Commands: Reusable Cypress custom commands for complex actions, making the tests more maintainable.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports running tests with different sets of data to verify multiple scenarios.
Environment-Specific Configurations: Cypress environment variables and custom configurations for different environments (e.g., staging, production).
Good Practices Followed
Modular Test Structure: Tests are organized into logical folders and files for easy navigation.
Reusable Test Functions: Common test steps are abstracted into reusable commands to avoid duplication.
Page Object Model: Implemented the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve maintainability.
CI/CD Integration: Cypress is configured to work seamlessly with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports running tests with various data sets to ensure robustness.
Error Handling: Tests include proper error handling and retry mechanisms for flaky elements.
Test Reporting: Integrated with test reporters (e.g., Mochawesome) for detailed and user-friendly test reports.
Environment Setup

## Features

🛠 Built with [React][reactjs], [XState][xstate], [Express][express], [lowdb][lowdb], [Material-UI][material-ui] and [TypeScript][typescript]
⚡️ Zero database dependencies
🚀 Full-stack [Express][express]/[React][reactjs] application with real-world features and tests
👮‍♂️ Local Authentication
🔥 Database Seeding with End-to-end Tests
💻 CI/CD + [Cypress Cloud][cypresscloud]

## Getting Started

The Cypress Real-World App (RWA) is a full-stack Express/React application backed by a local JSON database ([lowdb]).

The app is bundled with [example data](./data/database.json) (`data/database.json`) that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> You can login to the app with any of the [example app users](./data/database.json#L2). The default password for all users is `s3cret`.
> Example users can be seen by running `yarn list:dev:users`.

### Prerequisites

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your machine. Refer to the [.node-version](./.node-version) file for the exact version.

[Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) is also required. Once you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, execute the following to install the npm module [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) (Classic - version 1) globally.

```shell
npm install yarn@latest -g
```

If you have Node.js' experimental [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/corepack.html) feature enabled, then you should skip the step `npm install yarn@latest -g` to install Yarn Classic globally. The RWA project is locally configured for `Corepack` to use Yarn Classic (version 1).

#### Yarn Modern

**This project is not compatible with [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 2 and later).**

### Installation

To clone the repo to your local system and install dependencies, execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app
cd cypress-realworld-app
yarn
```

#### Mac users with M-series chips will need to prepend `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`.

```shell
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true yarn install
```

### Run the app

```shell
yarn dev
```

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> The app will run on port `3000` (frontend) and `3001` (API backend) by default. Please make sure there are no other applications or services running on both ports.
> If you want to change the default ports, you can do so by modifying `PORT` and `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` variables in `.env` file.
> However, make sure the modified port numbers in `.env` are not committed into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to run on the default ports.

### Start Cypress

```shell
yarn cypress:open
```

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> If you have changed the default ports, then you need to update Cypress configuration file (`cypress.config.ts`) locally.
> There are three properties that you need to update in `cypress.config.ts`: `e2e.baseUrl`, `env.apiUrl`, and `env.url`.
> The port number in `e2e.baseUrl` corresponds to `PORT` variable in `.env` file. Similarly, the port number in `env.apiUrl` and `env.url` correspond to `VITE_BACKEND_PORT`.
> For example, if you have changed `PORT` to `13000` and `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` to `13001` in `.env` file, then your `cypress.config.ts` should look similar to the following snippet:
>
> ```js
> {
>   env: {
>     apiUrl: "http://localhost:13001",
>     codeCoverage: {
>       url: "http://localhost:13001/__coverage__"
>     },
>   },
>   e2e: {
>     baseUrl: "http://localhost:13000"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Avoid committing the modified `cypress.config.ts` into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to be run on default ports.

## Tests

| Type      | Location                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| api       | [cypress/tests/api](./cypress/tests/api) |
| ui        | [cypress/tests/ui](./cypress/tests/ui)   |
| component | [src/(next to component)](./src)         |
| unit      | [`src/__tests__`](./src/__tests__)       |

## Database

- The local JSON database is located in [data/database.json](./data/database.json) and is managed with [lowdb].

- The database is [reseeded](./data/database-seed.json) each time the application is started (via `yarn dev`). Database seeding is done in between each [Cypress End-to-End test](./cypress/tests).

- Updates via the React frontend are sent to the [Express][express] server and handled by a set of [database utilities](backend/database.ts)

- Generate a new database using `yarn db:seed`.

- An [empty database seed](./data/empty-seed.json) is provided along with a script (`yarn start:empty`) to view the application without data.

## Additional NPM Scripts

For a complete list of scripts see [package.json](./package.json)

## Code Coverage Report

The Cypress Real-World App uses the [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) plugin to generate code coverage reports for the app frontend and backend.

To generate a code coverage report:

1. Start the development server with coverage enabled by running `yarn dev:coverage`.
2. Run `yarn cypress:run --env coverage=true` and wait for the test run to complete.
3. Once the test run is complete, you can view the report at `coverage/index.html`.

## 3rd Party Authentication Providers

Support for 3rd party authentication is available in the application to demonstrate the concepts on logging in with a 3rd party provider.

The app contains different entry points for each provider. There is a separate **index** file for each provider, and to use one, you must replace the current **index.tsx** file with the desired one. The following providers are supported:

- [Auth0](#auth0) (index.auth0.tsx)
- [Okta](#okta) (index.okta.tsx)
- [Amazon Cognito](#amazon-cognito) (index.cognito.tsx)
- [Google](#google) (index.google.tsx)

### Auth0

The [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) tests have been rewritten to take advantage of our [`cy.session`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) and [`cy.origin`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) commands.

Prerequisites include an Auth0 account and a Tenant configured for use with a SPA. Environment variables from Auth0 are to be placed in the [.env](./.env). For more details see [Auth0 Application Setup](http://on.cypress.io/auth0#Auth0-Application-Setup) and [Setting Auth0 app credentials in Cypress](http://on.cypress.io/auth0#Setting-Auth0-app-credentials-in-Cypress).

To start the application with Auth0, replace the current **src/index.tsx** file with the **src/index.auth0.tsx** file and start the application with `yarn dev:auth0` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The only passing spec on this branch will be the [auth0 spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/auth0.spec.ts); all others will fail. Please note that your test user will need to authorize your Auth0 app before the tests will pass.

### Okta

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](http://on.cypress.io/okta) to use [Okta][okta] and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an [Okta][okta] account and [application configured for use with a SPA][oktacreateapp]. Environment variables from [Okta][okta] are to be placed in the [.env](./.env).

To start the application with Okta, replace the current **src/index.tsx** file with the **src/index.okta.tsx** file and start the application with `yarn dev:okta` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The **only passing spec on this branch** will be the [okta spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/okta.spec.ts); all others will fail.

### Amazon Cognito

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](http://on.cypress.io/amazon-cognito) to use [Amazon Cognito][cognito] as the authentication solution and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an [Amazon Cognito][cognito] account. Environment variables from [Amazon Cognito][cognito] are provided by the [AWS Amplify CLI][awsamplify].

- A user pool is required (identity pool is not used here)
  - The user pool must have a hosted UI domain configured, which must:
    - allow callback and sign-out URLs of `http://localhost:3000/`,
    - allow implicit grant Oauth grant type,
    - allow these OpenID Connect scopes:
      - aws.cognito.signin.user.admin
      - email
      - openid
  - The user pool must have an app client configured, with:
    - enabled auth flow `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, only for programmatic login flavor of test.
    - The `cy.origin()` flavor of test only requires auth flow `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`, and does not require `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`.
  - The user pool must have a user corresponding to the `AWS_COGNITO` env vars mentioned below, and the user's Confirmation Status must be `Confirmed`. If it is `Force Reset Password`, then use a browser to log in once at `http://localhost:3000` while `yarn dev:cognito` is running to reset their password.

The test knobs are in a few places:

- The `.env` file has `VITE_AUTH_TOKEN_NAME` and vars beginning `AWS_COGNITO`. Be careful not to commit any secrets.
- Both `scripts/mock-aws-exports.js` and `scripts/mock-aws-exports-es5.js` must have the same data; only their export statements differ. These files can be edited manually or exported from the amplify CLI.
- `cypress.config.ts` has `cognito_programmatic_login` to control flavor of the test.

To start the application with Cognito, replace the current **src/index.tsx** file with the **src/index.cognito.tsx** file and start the application with `yarn dev:cognito` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`. `yarn dev` may need to have been run once first.

The **only passing spec on this branch** will be the [cognito spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/cognito.spec.ts); all others will fail.

### Google

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/testing-strategies/google-authentication.html) to use [Google][google] as the authentication solution and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an [Google][google] account. Environment variables from [Google][google] are to be placed in the [.env](./.env).

To start the application with Google, replace the current **src/index.tsx** file with the **src/index.google.tsx** file and start the application with `yarn dev:google` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The **only passing spec** when run with `yarn dev:google` will be the [google spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/google.spec.ts); all others will fail.

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!!

THere can be lot of untested use cases. - example mouse hover an element and click the delete button
soft and hard assert
why we use object.freeze
only and skip >> multiple it with only and multiple it with skip
beforeEach at describe level and context level, which will execute
each method
why we use . to get() commands
why we use css selector like element.class instead of .class
TAB plugin
I took the help from online
Add the comments
Any bug, it might be a bug that duplicate to-do items can be added, app loading gain delete the items
adding a high number of to-do items
When I go back it should not delete the to do items
Add tags
Add extensions
npm install should call pre-build and install extensions
type(`${}{enter}`,{delay:400})
I usually design the Page object model, but since this app doesn't have any pages so going with stand-alone test script
hard coded stings can be deleted
cy.get().contains() vs cy.get().should('have.text', '') //it match the full sting not a substring
Meaning and use of each file
Basic of Accessibility - a11y - https://www.browserstack.com/accessibility-testing/what-is-accessibility-testing
check / uncheck all matching
cy.get('ul.todo-list li input').check()

      patten to match in should have.text in todo spec file
